### MOCKITO (Unit testing):
Please refer to the following two files to get the pattern on Unit testing we can add with the MVP architecture.
- [DashBoardFragmentTest](https://github.com/AabidMulani/android-redmart-assignment/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/redmartassignment/android/app/fragment/DashBoardFragmentTest.java)
- [RedMartProductDetailsActivityTest](https://github.com/AabidMulani/android-redmart-assignment/blob/master/app/src/test/java/com/redmartassignment/android/app/activities/RedMartProductDetailsActivityTest.java)
